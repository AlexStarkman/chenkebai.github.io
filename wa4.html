	Introduction 
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		In U.S. dating culture, women tend to date men whose older than them. In contrast, the men tend to date women whose younger than them. The reality TV series The Bachelorette and The Bachelor did a great job in reflecting this dating norm in the U.S. Just in case you have never heard of these two TV shows before. The Bachelor is a reality TV show that showcases a love-seeking man who dates multiple women in the same time and trying to find the love of his life. The Bachelorette is a similar version of The Bachelor, but the main character is a woman who is seeking love from multiple man contestants. In order to support my theory, I did a simple data analysis and visualization using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants">The Bachelor & Bachelorette Contestants</a> created by Brian Gonzalez on Kaggle. The data set contains 4 different sub data set which includes the gets data from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette tv show. In those data set they includes features guest names, their age, their job, and when when each on of them get reatired from the TV show. The graph you can see below is a histogram that's showing the age comparison between the winner in each season of Bachelor(women) and the Bachelor of each season. Most of the time the bachelor's age is older than the winner's female contestant's age. (Winner female contestant's Age is the blue bar, the male bachelor's age is the orange bar). I then did an additional calculation to find out the average age difference between Winner female contestant from each season and the bachelor. I found out that in most cases the age difference between the winner female contestant from each season and the bachelor is around 5.8 years old, which is about 6 years different. As you can see the women are tends to date men who is generally older than them.

		In the second graph here I was expecting to see a similar situation that male contestants will have older age than bachelorette in general. But it doesn't seem to be the case. I think it really depends on how old the female bachelorette is. I think around their(bachelorette) the late 20s they tend to look for men whose slightly younger or at the same age as them. So I proceed to calculate the average age difference between Male contestant age and Bachelorette's age. By summing up the age in each group and divide the number of seasons. I got a -0.57 age difference(male contestants are younger in general). the age difference is small compare to The Bachelor TV show. I think the reason might due to most bachelorette(female) in the show are on the older side. Their age is more around 25 or older in their late 20s. Which is similar to men contestants' average age. Then it makes me wonder if females in dating looking more towards younger men? I think I will need more data to back up my theory.

	Other Studies Abot Why Women Likes to Date Older Men 
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		So I looked for other studies that give a more detailed explanation of why men in the U.S. tend to date women whose younger than them. I checked the article <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/is-this-the-real-reason-older-men-date-younger-women-20180108-h0f07p.html">Is this the real reason older men date younger women?</a> Before reading the article, I thought the reason men prefer to date younger women is that younger women look "better". According to the author Kerri Sackville and her quote from Stacy London, "the reason women are devalued as they age is that we've(women) internalized the male gaze." As Kerri Sackville said "For a man, an older partner is a constant reminder of his own age. He cannot pretend he's still thirty when he's waking up next to a fifty-year-old woman. A younger partner is life-affirming. She helps to stave off his own fear of aging and mortality. If a man can wake up next to a woman a decade or two younger, he can convince himself that he is still young." So because women have 'internalized the male gaze' the opposite can be true for us. So according to Sackville "If our partner sees us as young and hot, we see ourselves as young and hot. If he sees us as aging and undesirable, we internalize that, too. A man is only as young as the woman he feels, but a woman is only as young as a man sees her be." Sackville's reasoning can apply to both older men and women in dating preferences. But they may not be the only reason. I think women, in general, like to date older men is it's because socially older men are more mature, more experienced, financially more stable. So women will like that part of older men if they ready to commit a relationship and start a family.

	Reality TV Might Not Just Reflect Culture 
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		TV shows like The Bachelor and The Bachelorette really did a great job in reflecting the dating culture in North America. But not all TV shows are just able to reflect the culture, some even capable of making a change. For example, a TV show like "13 Reasons Why" does not only reflect the cruel reality of the current society (suicide culture, bully culture, and rape culture, etc.) The production team of the show also uses their TV shows as a platform (<a href="https://13reasonswhy.info/">13reasonswhy.info</a>) to propagate the resources from other platforms to help people who suffered from the bully, rape, assault, etc. to find the useful lifesaving resources, and to prevent further damage to the victim's life.

		Conclusion
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		In conclusion, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette may be just two reality TV shows that have tons of drama in them. But those TV shows also reflect the dating norm in North America. It shows people the dating culture in North America, which women tends to dates men whose older than them, and sometimes men tends women whose yonger than them. However not all TV shows are focusing on reflecting social culture. Sometimes TV shows like 13 Reasons Why also play an active role model to help provide resources and to educate people who involve in the social issue.
