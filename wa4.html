		In U.S. dateing culture, women tends to date men whose older then them. In contrast the men tends to date women whose yonger than them. The reality TV series The Bachelorette and The Bachelor did a grage job in reflecting this dateing norm in U.S. Just in case you have never heard these two TV show before. The Bachelor, is a reality TV show that showcase a love seeking men who dates multiple women in the same time, and trying to find the love of his life. The Bachelorette is a similar virsion of The Bachelor, but the main character is a women who is seeking love from multiple man contestants. In order to support my theory, I did a simple data analysis and visiualization using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants">The Bachelor & Bachelorette Contestants</a> created by Brian Gonzalez on Kaggle. The graph you can see below is a historgram that's shwoing the age compairsion between the winner in each season of Bachelor(women) and the Bachelor of each season. The most of the time the bachelor's age is older than the winner femal contestant's age. (Winner female contestant's Age is blue bar, the male bachelor's age is orange bar)
