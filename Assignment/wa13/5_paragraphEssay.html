        Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two different types of cryptocurrency I did some very surface level explore on how they are different, and the ways they are similar to each other. But first a little histry aboyt both crytocurrency.

        Lets talk about Bitcoin first considering it has longer history than Dogecoin. Accoridng some redaing I've done on Wiki the Bitcoin was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software. Bitcoin was created as a way for people to send money over the internet. The digital currency was intended to provide an alternative payment system that would operate free of central control but otherwise be used just like traditional currencies. For example, if I want to transfer large amount of money to someone but I want to avoid bank, government, or anyother hefty intrest fees I can use Bitcoin. Let's talk about Dogecoin. Which is also a cryptocurrency which was invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.

        In order to explor the difference between Dogecoin and Bitcoin. we have to take a look at the initial design idea behaiend these two cryptocurrencies. When scientists first designed Bitcoin they meant to make this type of cryptocurrency a better currency for money transactions. Dogecoin is more inspired by a joke meme created from the internet. According to journalist David Hamilton from Bitcoinlightning.com "Despite their technical similarities, these two projects entered the market with two very different purposes. Bitcoin was created to provide the world with a viable alternative to the current financial system. The coin’s coding and whitepaper are filled with indicators of this purpose."Dogecoin didn’t enter the market with such grand ideas in mind. Markus has stated that initially the coin was created as a joke. Like Bitcoin, his intentions are woven within the coin’s features. For example, the name Dogecoin and its now-famous Shiba Inu logo was a reference to a popular meme at the time. The coin didn’t originate with some divine purpose in mind, but rather, to make people smile and get a good laugh out of the select people they thought would ever see the project."

        So how hard is it to mine these two differrnt kinds of coins? For Dogecoin according to CoinWarz's calculator it would take 0.011 days to mine 1 Dogecoin at the current Dogecoin difficulty level along with the mining hashrate and block reward; a Dogecoin mining hashrate of 2,200,000.00 KH/s consuming 2,100.00 watts of power at $0.10 per kWh, and a block reward of 10000 DOGE which make the profit of mining $23.18 per day. It will cost $5.04 electricty perday. (Note these number is the average input provided by many miners recorded from internet). As for Bitcoin regardless of the number of miners, it still takes 10 minutes to mine one Bitcoin. At 600 seconds (10 minutes), all else being equal it will take 72,000 GW (or 72 Terawatts) of power to mine a Bitcoin using the average power usage provided by ASIC miners. As the power cost along it will probably cost $4,161.00 to mine 1 Bitcoin. At the time I created this essay 1 Bitcoin worth $47,995 dollars. So Revenue - Cost gets you profit of approximently $43,834 of profit.

    <p class="text-md-left">
        So which one should we invest or even mine? One note I want to leave it here is that Dogecoin is currently infinite. That means miners around the world can continue to solve blocks and earn new Dogecoin forever. By comparison, Bitcoin is limited to 21 million tokens, 18.7 million of which already exist. That's because every 210,000 blocks, the Bitcoin earned for solving a block is cut in half. In other words, at some point in the future, the reward will effectively be zero. And after that time, Bitcoin miners will only earn transaction fees. Also the Bit coin adopts the current market better considering it has larger user base than Dogecoin.
