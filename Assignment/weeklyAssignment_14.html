		I personally think CSS bootstrap and Reveal JS is the best way to interpret information to general audiences. Let's talk about Reveal JS first, Reveal.JS (reveal.js) is an open-source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create a fully-featured slide dec for free. The key takeaway is that it utilized HTML and JavaScript to allow users to create functional presentation slides. Users who have coding knowledge can use their library to develop a user-friendly presentation about the work they did on data analysis like (TV data) we did this semester. At the same time code showcase feature in both Bootstrap and reveal.js allows people who programed the web to present code to appeal to more audiences like other data scientists or programmers. Therefore I would say if I would only choose one out of Bootstrap, reveal.js, and Jupyter notebook I would choose reveal.js. Simply because it appeals to a broader audience, very user-friendly, easy to make and it's compatible with the Vega source. Let's say if I want to do some data visualization but I have to combine two different data set and do some filtering and preprocessing the data I would use Jupyter Notebook to do the data processing and use Altair in Python to visualize data in Jupyter Notebook. Then I'll use reveal.js to create a web-activated slide structure. Then I can export the plot out in Vega format so I can later copy the Vega source I exported from Jupyter notebook to reveal.js and visualize it on the website.

		Bootstrap on the other hand is also a very powerful and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. Compair to reveal. js CSS bootstrap is a more traditional website layout-oriented framework. Which also appeals to a very broad audience. But compair to reveal.js Bootstrap is designed for individual use instead of a group showcase. Because a traditional layout website is less directive when it comes to information showcase, instead users have to navigate the website themself to make sense of the information presented on the website.

		Jupyter notebook in my opinion is an open-source development tool that allows people to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter notebook is not designed to present data to all kinds of audiences, considering its interface is heavily program biased. General audiences who have never done the program might think the data or the information that is presented using the jupyter notebook could be a bit too overwhelming to them. But It is perfect for data scientists who use Jupyter notebook or programmer who has experience in this type of platform.
