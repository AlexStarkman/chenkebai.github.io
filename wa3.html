	Summery of the reading and Reddit stock event.
</h1>

<p>
I read the article "GameStop, Bitcoin and QAnon: How the Wisdom of Crowds Became the Anarchy of the Mob" from The Wall Street Journal. If you don't know what exactly happened here is a short brief. Basically, a group of keyboard warriors simultaneously end wealth inequality and bring down “predatory” hedge funds. In the Game Stop event the Reddit user and other "keyboard warriors" were "buying shares and options of GameStop in order to squeeze short-sellers who were betting the stock would drop. The result was a buying frenzy that lofted the stock’s value into the stratosphere, well beyond any price at which it reflected a plausible future for the fundamentals of GameStop’s business." The article then uses the Game Stop stock event to compare with the Washington DC riot, both event is similar in a way that they all require the power of social media to spread the word of chaos.

	How Social Media Became the Perfect Catalyst of Chaos
</h1>

<p>
So how exactly is social media "helping" and "generating" mob behavior? According to the author of the article Christopher Mims. It's caused by the design deficiency of the social media algorithm. These algorithms on these social media platforms will scan their entire platform to select the most engaging content. Which are the content that moves, inspires, and/or terrifies people and push these content in front of platform uses' tread so everyone can see it. Gradually this information will become mainstream. But of course, just having that kind of power may not be enough to motivate a ton of people to go nuts. I think quarantine also plays a significant role in both mob behavior in DC, and GameStop's stock crisis. There are study showing that when human are being isolated for too long, human tends to get impatient, and easy to get influenced by the environment. That will allow informations like Trump tweets to influence angry Trump supporters to join capital rioting, and angry stockholders rallies and start buying the same stock from Game Stop. Notice that most of these "revolution" is plotted by a minority amount of people. Most people who later follows the action are not aware of what's going on, and also due to quarantine, they are easily carried away by other people's words. So, people, these days don't think much. They see an opportunity then they went for it.

	What Can We Learn From This
</h1>

<p>
The lesson that we can learn from this mistake is that all these terrible events are preventable by practicing proper human monitoring and interference. We know that all these tweets and Reddit data are monitorable by data scientists from Twitter and Reddit. These people know what information is the most trending across platforms. They can better design their platform's machine learning algorithm to detect if any unlawful collective activities are being generated in certain groups or threads or postes. If they are being detected, the thread should be either temporarily deactivated, or permanently deactivated. We have to also realize it is extremely important to have regulation on certain social media platforms. Although, platforms like Reddit stand for free speech. But they have to realize that, as a company whose making a profit by generating data from people, they are also playing an important role to prevent their users from getting "brainwashed" from negative posts on their platforms. It reminds me of a video game I played called Assassin's Creed Odyssey. In the game, it says, "at the end of the day, 'chaos' and 'order' should be balanced. If there is too much chaos, there will be endless rioting, if there is too much order, there will be no freedom." In this social media situation. We broke the balance by having too much chaos, not enough rules. Thus it leads to people gets so irrationally angry that leads them to commit crimes in D.C. Also led to people breaking rules in trading GameStop's stock.

	My Thought On How We Could Do Better
</h1>

<p>
To answer some of the questions in this homework, I believe there should be a designated ethics group and a team of data scientists working together to develop an algorithm that detects the information that their user has been posted online. They should also monitor how the information is being reposted, by tracking key words in the post, hashtags used in the post, etc. If possible, we need also to keep track of the demographic of those reposts. If we can also generate geographical data from repost, we can create a data visualization that tracks the movement of these users, as they are tweeting, retweeting, and posting on social media on the map. We could use that information to prevent massive violent protests. By using the keywords to analyze different users' posts, we can categorize different users and see if they are posting material that encourages collective unlawful behavior, so the platform can sensor that information from the public. Overall it's not just a problem about how to design an algorithm. It's also a ethic problem, that will take more than 500 words to discuss. But what we can do right now is to prevent individuals to use social media to encourage and mislead people on mass violent activity. I believe as we move on, there will be more issues related to social media, especially about how to deal with the massive amounts of data. How to ethically collect and analyze these data is a life long question.
