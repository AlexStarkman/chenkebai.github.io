		Redesign of The Home Page
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		For the <a class="btn btn-primary" href="homePage.html" role="button">home page</a> I added the navigation bar using the <a href=https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs>Navs&Tabs</a> example section from getboostrap.com. This feature will add navigation bar allows user to navigate between different pages more easily and it looks cleaner as well.

	<h1 class = "centerOperation"> Redesign of My Resume Page </h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		I have also added the navigation bar on <a class="btn btn-primary" href="resume.html" role="button">My Resume</a> Page just to keep that consistency between pages, also added the navbar to maintain accessibility across different pages. Beyond the navigation bar, I also added the background color and updated version of pdf display for my resume. I also added a button(link) feature at the bottom of My Resume Page that allows readers to visit My Portfolio Page after finishing reading my resume.

	<h1 class="centerOperation">
		Redesign of My Portfolio Page
	</h1>

	<p class="paragraphFontSize">
		In the redesign of <a class="btn btn-primary" href="portfolio.html" role="button">my portfolio page</a>, the first thing I did was also add the navigation bar to keep the consistency. Besides that, I also did the card feature to showcase the previous work that I've done in the past. The car also has buttons so users can click on the button to go with different links to a different website.

	<h1 class= "centerOperation">
		Redesign of Contact page
	</h1>

	<p class = "paragraphFontSize">
		On the <a class="btn btn-primary" href="contact.html" role="button">contact</a> page, what I did was also adding the navbar feature, and also I tried to use the wrapper function to create 2 half rows to display the contact information and my address.
